        "* Don't write extremely long lines of code; they're hard to understand. People commonly limit themselves to lines that are 79 or 99 characters long. If you feel that you need to write longer lines, consider rewriting and simplifying your code.\n",

Following standard guidelines on code style help make a lot of code easier to read. So it’s a good idea to follow the guidelines, even with one-line expressions, it’ll help you write readable code in the long run. Each time you learn something new it will be useful to refer back to PEP 8 to get your Python style right."
